<!--
    Use this directory to house your PowerShell modules
    functionality. This directory should always consists of a
    ".\public" and ".\private" function directory, and a module
    manifest (.psd1) file. If it is a Script module, this
    directory will also include a PowerShell script module
    (.psm1) file.

    I've left you a few TODOs in some of the files... Let's see
    how you do, using the examples discovered while
    investigating my changes.
